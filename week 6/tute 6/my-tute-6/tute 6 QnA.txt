what is transfer learning:
ANS: we have useda large dataset to train a model, we already train for cat dog and fish, 
but we want to now add lion into the classifcaiotn
do a bit of fine tuning and configuration so we can apply the training to the tiger class


why do we need tanh instead if sigmoid?
ANS: 
- due to the nature of the program 


ELU unit
- when it goes down to negative, 

Batch normalization
- tries to transform
Case study: 
- when we d SGD, separate 10 batches, 
- unfortunately get 3 batches we get all black dogs, 
- but in reality we still have yellow and red dogs and so on.
- we find that the blck dogs shift towards the left side. 

it is normalizing the output to feed into the next layer
